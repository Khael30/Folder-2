            In our clinic, we understand that Scoliosis, a disease that makes the spine curve sideways
by more than 10°
, can happen at any age, mostly at the teenage years just before puberty
when growth is most rapid. Scoliosis is the spine rotation which results in the tilting of the rib
cage or back. While fusion is the most extreme case, most of them don't need it, especially in
the early stages.

        </P> </div>

       <div class="the"> <p>
            The scoliosis in adolescents should be monitored constantly because the curves can grow
more than expected, and the old idea that the curves improve with age has been proven
wrong, the adults can also have their curves worsen over time. The adults with scoliosis are
observed to have their curves to become deeper at the average rate of 1. 47° per year. The
first and the most real assessment is the basis for the right treatment that is specific to
scoliosis, traction therapies, and bracing. The scoliosis can be treated effectively if it is taken
care of properly so many cases of scoliosis can be treated without surgery. If you or a friend
of yours has scoliosis, we are here to assist you with the full examination and a lot of
treatment options.

        <p><div class="adolescent">
            Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the most prevalent type, has no known reason and usually
occurs during the rapid growth phases of kids, mainly from the ages of 10 to 13. The cause
of this phenomenon remains a mystery, however, the factors such as age, curve size, and
skeletal maturity can be the predictors of the occurrence of the increase in the curve. The
evaluation and monitoring of small curves are even more important than the usual ones to
reduce the risks. Adult-onset scoliosis, which is a common problem, usually occurs in people
whose spine has degenerated over time. The force of gravity and time show to be the cause
of the degenerative changes, which then are complemented by each other to become the
reason of the aggravation of the curvature over time.

        </p> </div>
      <div class="poor"> <p>
            Poor posture or even the traumatic incidents can worsen scoliosis and other misalignments,
which proves that the regular chiropractic care is very essential. Some of the therapy
techniques specifically designed for scoliosis can help a lot in the maintenance and
management of the condition.
