        <div class="often"></p>   Often a chronic neck pain creates immoveable positions in neck, shoulders, upper back and arms which leads
             to daily headaches. One of the kinds of pain i am referring to occurs as nerve irritation result from
              joint degeneration. There are two approaches in neck pain which must be identified. The first is the root cause of the pain and not the immediate relief giving pain relievers. 
              Ask Chiropractic Health & Wellness in Edina to see a doctor and get a proper diagnosis as well as to build a treatment plan for your neck pain problems.</p></div>
        <div class="these"><p>These include the articular process that halt the movements of the head,
             the vertebral disc made of cartilage that enclose the spinal cord or vertebral column,
              the canals for nerves and blood vessels, and the myriad of ligaments that serve to hold
               the various anatomical structures together. On the one hand, these small and lightweight
                air crafts offer a significant degree of maneuverability but, on the other, they are also
                 very vulnerable and can be targeted by different kinds of physical attacks. </p></div>
        <div class="various"><p>Various abnormalities in the bone structure of the neck vertebrae Several kinds
             of joint issues Poor posture which generally develops over a number of years Repetitive stress,
              such as performing a work procedure over and over Whiplash or some other form of physical trauma
               Awkward sleeping position Muscle pulls or strains which go untreated Spinal misalignment and loss
                of normal movement </p></div>
        <div class="when"><p>  When it is your neck that is in pain, it could touch your entire system including
             each organ in the body. The spinal cord is sheathed and protected by the neck bones. The spinal cord
              is a bundle of fibers that goes to every corner of the body. Primarily affected are nerves, which exit
               the spinal cord and go to your shoulders, arms, and hands. With a neck pressure build-up, the nerves
                can become inflamed causing a variety of conditions that include the pain radiates into shoulders and
                 upper back, pain down the arm, numbness and tingling in hands and fingers, and reduced strength of hands
                  (grip strength). </p></div>
        <div class="themost"> <p> The most common response of those who experience infinitesimal neck pain at the start will 
            be to simply overlook it and wait for it to disappear. If that neck pain is a result of the vertebrae not being
             properly positioned then not only they will return but the misalignment of the vertebrae could become more severe.
              Without a doubt, if you experience something like the lightest neck pain, always make an appointment with an 
              experienced chiropractor at ValChiro Center.
