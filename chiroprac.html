           <div class="val"> <p><b>Valenzuela Chiropractic Center (ValChiro) </b>doctors are specialists
                 in the diagnostics and treatment of spinal and joint problems to
                 boost the general well-being and the performance of the patients.
                The spine being misaligned can affect the nerves, which in turn 
                affect the muscles, the sensation, and the internal organs. It's
                a false belief that there are no symptoms, thus no problems;
                serious issues can be present even without symptoms, just like
                heart disease and cancer. The symptoms tell that the body is
                not able to adjust, and this is a sign that lifestyle changes
                are required. Systematic spinal and nervous system 
                examinations are essential for the maintenance of health,
                thus avoiding the necessity of drugs or surgery. The 
                principle of chiropractic care is the body's capability
                to cure itself when provided with the appropriate
                conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chiro">
                <p> Chiropractic adjustments that are made upon thorough physical
                    exams and x-rays, correct the spinal dysfunction and
                    misalignments, hence the normal movement and pain relief can
                    be restored, so as to reduce the inflammation, muscle spasms,
                    and nerve irritation. These changes, either performed
                    manually or with instruments, are usually without any pain
                    and are safe, thus, they not only provide local but also
                    systemic advantages. The discrepancies, of which one is
                    getting bigger and the other one is getting smaller,
                    cause the brain to send positive (proprioception) and
                    negative (nociception) messages, thus the brain stress
                    response level goes up and it too affects the health,
                    blood pressure, sleep and immunity. The direct
                    treatment is for the relief of the pain, while 
                    the long-term treatment is for the complete function
                    and lasts for several months. The majority of the
                    patients get improved health and enhanced physical
                    performance with the regular chiropractic care
                    and then they make it a part of their life.
                    In addition to the spine, chiropractic care
                    also influences other parts of the body and
                    gives you various health benefits, so you
                    can opt for a care plan that is appropriate
                    for your particular requirements and objectives.
